For the PDB:
	1) We need to set Continuous Mode
	2) Set a prescalar of 128
	3) Set a multiplication factor of 20
	4) Set software triggering and PDB enabled
	5) 	//Set the mod field to get a 1 second period.
	    //There is a division by 2 to make the LED blinking period 1 second.
	    //This translates to two mod counts in one second (one for on, one for off)
	6) Enable LDOk to have PDB0_SC register changes loaded
	
For the FTM:
	1) Turn off FTM Mode to write protection
	2) Divide the input clock down by 128
	3) reset counter to zero
	4) Select the system clock
